IVR Creation Application

This application allows you to create IVR (Interactive Voice Response) recordings and use them on your Asterisk telephone switchboard.

Use

To create the IVR record, fill out the "Update IVR Record" form:
Enter basic information like "IVR Name" and "IVR Code".
Fill in the "Set Timeout" and "Incorrect Dial Settings" sections.
In the "IVR Dials" section, add or remove IVR dials and destinations.
After completing the registration, create your IVR registration by clicking the "Submit" button.
Once the IVR record is created successfully, you will receive a success message. Otherwise, you will receive an error message stating that you need to fill in the missing information.
Your IVR record is automatically added to your Asterisk telephone switchboard.
